This project implements an order processing and payment system using Apache Pulsar functions, gRPC, and Docker. The system is designed to handle high-concurrency order requests, process payments, and finalize orders, all in an asynchronous and scalable manner.

## Overview

This system is composed of multiple services:
- **gRPC Server**: Receives order requests and forwards them to the order processing service.
- **Order Processing Service**: A Pulsar function that processes incoming orders.
- **Payment Processing Service**: A Pulsar function that processes payment for the orders.
- **Order Finalization Service**: A Pulsar function that finalizes the order processing based on payment results.

The services communicate via Apache Pulsar topics, with data being transferred in JSON format between Pulsar functions.

## Architecture

The architecture of this system involves several components working together:

- **gRPC Client**: Submits order requests.
- **gRPC Server**: Forwards order requests to the order processing system.
- **Apache Pulsar**: Facilitates messaging between the services.
- **MySQL**: Stores entire sytem data(logs, orders, transactions).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed on your machine.
- **Go** (1.19 or higher) for local development and testing.
- **Pulsar CLI** for managing Pulsar functions.
- **Pulsar Admin CLI** for managing Pulsar topics.
- **gRPC** for communication between services.


### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/dawitel/addispay-project.git
    cd order-payment-system
    ```

2. **Build the Docker images**:
    ```sh
    cd scripts && ./build.sh
    ```

3. **Start the services**:
    ```sh
    cd scripts && ./start.sh
    ```

4. **Deploy Pulsar functions**:
    ```sh
    cd scripts && ./deploy_pulsar_functions.sh
    ```

## Usage

1. **Submit Orders**: Use a gRPC client to submit order requests to the gRPC server. The server listens on port `50051`.

2. **Monitor Services**: Check the logs and status of services using `docker-compose logs` and `docker-compose ps`.

3. **Scaling**: Adjust the number of replicas or resources allocated to the services by modifying the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Testing

To run tests, use the provided test script:

```sh
cd scripts && ./test.sh
```

This script runs unit tests for the gRPC server and Pulsar functions. Ensure that the environment is properly set up before running the tests.

## Deployment

1. **Build Docker Images**:
    ```sh
    cd scripts && ./build.sh
    ```

2. **Push to Docker Registry**: Use the `deploy.sh` script to push Docker images to your registry.
    ```sh
    cd scripts && ./deploy.sh
    ```

3. **Deploy**: Deploy the images to your target environment (e.g., Kubernetes, AWS ECS).
